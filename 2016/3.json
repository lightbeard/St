Included in the survey are companies that are incorporated in the U.S. and operate in the U.S. and file financial statements with a government agency. This includes private companies and cooperatives that file a 10-K or a comparable financial statement with a government agency, and mutual insurance companies that file with state regulators. It also includes companies that file with a government agency but are owned by private companies, domestic or foreign, that do not file such financial statements. Excluded are private companies not filing with a government agency; companies incorporated outside the U.S.; and U.S. companies consolidated by other companies, domestic or foreign, that file with a government agency. Also excluded are companies that failed to report full financial statements for at least three-quarters of the current fiscal year. Percent change calculations for revenue, net income, and earnings per share are based on data as originally reported. They are not restated for mergers, acquisitions, or accounting changes. The only changes to the prior years\u2019 data are for significant restatement due to reporting errors that require a company to file an amended 10-K.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERevenues\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERevenues are as reported, including revenues from discontinued operations when published. If a spin-off is on the list, it has not been included in discontinued operations. Revenues for commercial banks includes interest and noninterest revenues. Revenues for insurance companies include premium and annuity income, investment income, and capital gains or losses, but exclude deposits. Revenues figures for all companies include consolidated subsidiaries and exclude excise taxes. Data shown are for the fiscal year ended on or before Jan. 31, 2016. Unless otherwise noted, all figures are for the year ended Dec. 31, 2015.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProfits\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EProfits are shown after taxes, extraordinary credits or charges, cumulative effects of accounting changes, and noncontrolling interests (including subsidiary preferred dividends), but before preferred dividends of the company. Figures in parentheses indicate a loss. Profit declines of more than 100% reflect swings from 2014 profits to 2015 losses. Profits for real estate investment trusts, partnerships, and cooperatives are reported but are not comparable with those of the other companies on the list because they are not taxed on a comparable basis. Profits for mutual insurance companies are based on statutory accounting.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBalance Sheet\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAssets are the company\u2019s year-end total. Total stockholders\u2019 equity is the sum of all capital stock, paid-in capital, and retained earnings at the company\u2019s year-end. Excluded is equity attributable to noncontrolling interests. Also excluded is redeemable preferred stock whose redemption is either mandatory or outside the company\u2019s control.

Per-share earnings are adjusted for stock splits and stock dividends. Though earnings-per-share numbers are not marked by footnotes, if a company\u2019s profits are footnoted it can be assumed that earnings per share is affected as well. The five-year and 10-year earnings-growth rates are the annual rates, compounded.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETotal Return to Investors\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETotal return to investors includes both price appreciation and dividend yield to an investor in the company\u2019s stock. The figures shown assume sales at the end of 2015 of stock owned at the end of 2005, 2010, and 2014. It has been assumed that any proceeds from cash dividends and stock received in spin-offs were reinvested when they were paid. Returns are adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations, and corporate reorganizations as they occurred; however, no effort has been made to reflect the cost of brokerage commissions or of taxes. Total-return percentages shown are the returns received by the hypothetical investor described above. The five-year and 10-year returns are the annual rates, compounded.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMedians\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENo attempt has been made to calculate median figures in the tables for groups of fewer than four companies. The medians for profit changes from 2014 to 2015 do not include companies that lost money in 2014 or lost money in both 2014 and 2015, because no meaningful percentage changes can be calculated in such cases.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECredits\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis \u003Cem\u003EFortune\u003C\/em\u003E 500 Directory was prepared under the direction of list editor Scott DeCarlo. Income statement and balance sheet data provided by the companies were reviewed and verified against published earnings releases, 10-K filings, and annual reports by reporter Douglas G.

In addition, we used data provided by Thomson Reuters and S\u0026amp;P Global Market Intelligence to calculate total return and market capitalization. Database administrator Larry Shine provided technical support. Researcher Viki Goldman assisted with the data gathering and verification.

Last year that was not a good thing: Sales dropped 16.6%, and profits declined 17.7%. The processor of goods like corn and wheat has been hurt by a strong dollar and a grain surplus, reducing the demand for the North American supply it processes and sells. Low oil prices and a glut of ethanol also cut into its manufacturing of the fuel additive. Management is trying to remake ADM accordingly, selling off its cocoa business and considering shedding stakes in operations like corn mills that make ethanol. Meanwhile, ADM acquired companies like Wild Flavors, Eatem Foods, and SCI to capitalize on consumers shifting their preferences toward natural goods. ADM also has made investments in organic, gluten-free ingredient company Harvest Innovation and sugar supplier Wilmar International to gain a bigger footprint in Asia.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","rank":"41","thumbnail":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/41archerdanielsmidland.jpg?w=840\u0026h=485\u0026crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Daniel Acker \u2014 Bloomberg via Getty Images","caption":"The Archer Daniels Midland Co.

The company will have to wade through significant regulatory hurdles and medical industry blowback in its quest.

The New York-based drug maker, which benefited from its blockbuster medication Lipitor before it went off patent, was hoping to reduce its tax rate through the $150 billion deal, which would have been the largest pharmaceutical merger in history. Instead, Pfizer will have to focus on reviving its core business, which has been in decline. The company\u0026#8217;s sales dropped 1.5% in 2015 as it still deals with the impact of patent expirations on some of its biggest drugs. Its profits, meanwhile, fell nearly 24%, largely due to a surge in acquisition-related costs, which more than quintupled from the previous year due to Pfizer\u0026#8217;s purchase of Hospira in early 2015. Pfizer\u0026#8217;s stock fell 14.2% in 2015, a result of its performance as well as concerns that drug price regulation could hamper its profitability.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","rank":"55","thumbnail":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/55pfizer1.jpg?w=840\u0026h=485\u0026crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Simon Dawson \u2014 Bloomberg via Getty Images","caption":"The Pfizer logo sits on Viagra tablets, produced by Pfizer Inc., inside a blister pack sitting on a pharmacy counter in this arranged photograph in London, U.K., on Monday, Dec. 14, 2015.
