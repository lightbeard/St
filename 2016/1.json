Included in the survey are companies that are incorporated in the U.S. and operate in the U.S. and file financial statements with a government agency. This includes private companies and cooperatives that file a 10-K or a comparable financial statement with a government agency, and mutual insurance companies that file with state regulators. It also includes companies that file with a government agency but are owned by private companies, domestic or foreign, that do not file such financial statements. Excluded are private companies not filing with a government agency; companies incorporated outside the U.S.; and U.S. companies consolidated by other companies, domestic or foreign, that file with a government agency. Also excluded are companies that failed to report full financial statements for at least three-quarters of the current fiscal year. Percent change calculations for revenue, net income, and earnings per share are based on data as originally reported. They are not restated for mergers, acquisitions, or accounting changes. The only changes to the prior years\u2019 data are for significant restatement due to reporting errors that require a company to file an amended 10-K.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERevenues\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERevenues are as reported, including revenues from discontinued operations when published. If a spin-off is on the list, it has not been included in discontinued operations. Revenues for commercial banks includes interest and noninterest revenues. Revenues for insurance companies include premium and annuity income, investment income, and capital gains or losses, but exclude deposits. Revenues figures for all companies include consolidated subsidiaries and exclude excise taxes. Data shown are for the fiscal year ended on or before Jan. 31, 2016. Unless otherwise noted, all figures are for the year ended Dec. 31, 2015.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProfits\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EProfits are shown after taxes, extraordinary credits or charges, cumulative effects of accounting changes, and noncontrolling interests (including subsidiary preferred dividends), but before preferred dividends of the company. Figures in parentheses indicate a loss. Profit declines of more than 100% reflect swings from 2014 profits to 2015 losses. Profits for real estate investment trusts, partnerships, and cooperatives are reported but are not comparable with those of the other companies on the list because they are not taxed on a comparable basis. Profits for mutual insurance companies are based on statutory accounting.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBalance Sheet\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAssets are the company\u2019s year-end total. Total stockholders\u2019 equity is the sum of all capital stock, paid-in capital, and retained earnings at the company\u2019s year-end. Excluded is equity attributable to noncontrolling interests. Also excluded is redeemable preferred stock whose redemption is either mandatory or outside the company\u2019s control.

Per-share earnings are adjusted for stock splits and stock dividends. Though earnings-per-share numbers are not marked by footnotes, if a company\u2019s profits are footnoted it can be assumed that earnings per share is affected as well. The five-year and 10-year earnings-growth rates are the annual rates, compounded.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETotal Return to Investors\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETotal return to investors includes both price appreciation and dividend yield to an investor in the company\u2019s stock. The figures shown assume sales at the end of 2015 of stock owned at the end of 2005, 2010, and 2014. It has been assumed that any proceeds from cash dividends and stock received in spin-offs were reinvested when they were paid. Returns are adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations, and corporate reorganizations as they occurred; however, no effort has been made to reflect the cost of brokerage commissions or of taxes. Total-return percentages shown are the returns received by the hypothetical investor described above.

The medians for profit changes from 2014 to 2015 do not include companies that lost money in 2014 or lost money in both 2014 and 2015, because no meaningful percentage changes can be calculated in such cases.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECredits\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis \u003Cem\u003EFortune\u003C\/em\u003E 500 Directory was prepared under the direction of list editor Scott DeCarlo.

A continued assault from revitalized wireless carrier T-Mobile helped strip away almost two million of AT\u0026amp;T\u0026#8217;s monthly mobile subscribers. And the old legacy landline phone business accelerated its decline, losing almost 10% of its revenue from the year before. So CEO Randall Stephenson made two bold gambles that may \u2014 or may not \u2014 pay off in coming years. First, he spent almost $50 billion to acquire satellite television provider DirecTV. Along with its existing cable television offering Uverse, the move immediately made AT\u0026amp;T one of the largest TV subscription services in the world with 26 million U.S. customers and 19 million overseas. AT\u0026amp;T also acquired Nextel Mexico and Iusacell for less than $5 billion. Combining the two and upgrading its Mexican infrastructure could pay off if Latin America continues to grow faster than many other parts of the world. In the meantime, AT\u0026amp;T can profit from the immense flow of trade and communication between the U.S. and Mexico. The television play looks riskier, as cord cutting accelerates among millennials and Internet video services like \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/netflix-379\/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003ENetflix\u003C\/a\u003E gain momentum.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","rank":"10","thumbnail":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/10att.jpg?w=840\u0026h=485\u0026crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Mark Lennihan \u2014 AP","caption":"A display of phones, tablets and accessories is shown at an AT\u0026amp;T company store, Wednesday, May 6, 2015 in New York.

In the process, Immelt is dismantling the legacy of his legendary predecessor, Jack Welch. In early 2015, Immelt and his team made the landmark decision to sell most of GE Capital, the lending business built by Welch that once generated half of the conglomerate\u2019s profits but sank under the heavy regulatory regime adopted following the financial crisis. In just eighteen months, Immelt has sold, or reached agreements to shed, $171 billion of the financial arm\u2019s $200 billion in assets. In mid-January 2016, GE agreed to unload another barely profitable bulwark, its consumer appliance franchise, to Haier of China for $5.4 billion. Immelt is betting heavily on lighting homes and powering plants across the globe; in November, GE acquired the power generation arm of France\u2019s Alstom for $10 billion, greatly strengthening its reach in gas-fired, \u201ccombined cycle\u201d plants that are driving the industry\u2019s growth. So far, the results are mixed. In the first quarter, three GE staples \u2014 jet engines, medical equipment, and power generation \u2014 all showed good revenue growth, while two others, oil and gas, and transportation equipment, including locomotives, dropped sharply. All told GE\u2019s industrial profits fell 7% from the first quarter of 2015. Indeed, the strategic thrust is daring, and so far shareholders are applauding: Since the start of 2015, GE\u2019s stock has delivered a 25% return, easily waxing the S\u0026amp;P 500 by 23 points.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","rank":"11","thumbnail":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/11generalelectric4.jpg?w=840\u0026h=485\u0026crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Courtesy of General Electric","caption":"Images included in the 2011 AR printed version","attach_id":"1662777"},"featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/11generalelectric4.jpg?w=840\u0026h=485\u0026crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Courtesy of General Electric","caption":"Images included in the 2011 AR printed version","attach_id":"1662777"},"tables":{"Company Info":{"columns":[null],"data":{"CEO":["Jeffrey R.
