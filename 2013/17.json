Included in the survey are companies that are incorporated in the U.S. and operate in the U.S. and file financial statements with a government agency. This includes private companies and cooperatives that file a 10-K or a comparable financial statement with a government agency, and mutual insurance companies that file with state regulators. It also includes companies that file with a government agency but are owned by private companies, domestic or foreign, that do not file such financial statements. Excluded are private companies not filing with a government agency; companies incorporated outside the U.S.; and U.S. companies owned or controlled by other companies, domestic or foreign, that file with a government agency. Also excluded are companies that failed to report full financial statements for at least three quarters of the current fiscal year. Percent change calculations for revenues, net income, and earnings per share are based on data as originally reported. They are not restated for mergers, acquisitions, or accounting changes. The only changes to the prior years\u2019 data are for significant restatement due to reporting errors that require a company to file an amended 10-K.\n\nRevenues\n\nRevenues are as reported, including revenues from discontinued operations when published. If a spinoff is on the list, it has not been included in discontinued operations. Revenues for commercial banks and savings institutions are interest and noninterest revenues. Revenues for insurance companies include premium and annuity income, investment income, and capital gains or losses but exclude deposits. Revenues figures for all companies include consolidated subsidiaries and exclude excise taxes. Data shown are for the fiscal year ended on or before Jan. 31, 2013. Unless otherwise noted, all figures are for the year ended Dec. 31, 2012.\n\nProfits\n\nProfits are shown after taxes, extraordinary credits or charges, cumulative effects of accounting changes, and noncontrolling interests (including subsidiary preferred dividends), but before preferred dividends of the company. Figures in parentheses indicate a loss. Profit declines of more than 100% reflect swings from 2011 profits to 2012 losses. Profits for real estate investment trusts, partnerships, and cooperatives are reported but are not comparable with those of the other companies on the list because they are not taxed on a comparable basis. Profits for mutual insurance companies are based on statutory accounting.\n\nBalance Sheet\n\nAssets are the company\u2019s year-end total. Total stockholders\u2019 equity is the sum of all capital stock, paid-in capital, and retained earnings at the company\u2019s year-end. Excluded is equity attributable to noncontrolling interests. Also excluded is redeemable preferred stock whose redemption is either mandatory or outside the company\u2019s control. Dividends paid on such stock have been subtracted from the profit figures used in calculating return on equity.\nEmployees\n\nThe figure shown is a fiscal year-end number as published by the company in its annual report. Where the breakdown between full- and part-time employees is supplied, a part-time employee is counted as one-half of a full-time employee. Earnings Per Share The figure shown for each company is the diluted earnings-per-share figure that appears on the income statement. Per-share earnings are adjusted for stock splits and stock dividends. Though earnings-per-share numbers are not marked by footnotes, if a company\u2019s profits are footnoted it can be assumed that earnings per share are affected as well. The five-year and 10-year earnings-growth rates are the annual rates, compounded.\n\nTotal Return to Investors\n\nTotal return to investors includes both price appreciation and dividend yield to an investor in the company\u2019s stock. The figures shown assume sales at the end of 2012 of stock owned at the end of 2002, 2007, and 2011. It has been assumed that any proceeds from cash dividends and stock received in spinoffs were reinvested when they were paid. Returns are adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations, and corporate reorganizations as they occurred; however, no effort has been made to reflect the cost of brokerage commissions or of taxes. Total-return percentages shown are the returns received by the hypothetical investor described above. The five-year and 10-year returns are the annual rates, compounded.\n\nMedians\n\nNo attempt has been made to calculate the median figures in the tables for groups of fewer than four companies. The medians for profit changes from 2011 to 2012 do not include companies that lost money in 2011 or lost money in both 2011 and 2012, because no meaningful percentage changes can be calculated in such cases.\nCredits\n\nThis Fortune 500 Directory was prepared under the direction of senior editor L. Michael Cacace. Income statement and balance sheet data provided by the companies were reviewed and verified against published earnings releases, 10-K filings, and annual reports by reporter Douglas G. Elam and accounting specialists Richard K. Tucksmith and Rhona Altschuler. Markets editor Kathleen Smyth used those same sources to check the data for earnings per share. In addition, she used data provided by Thomson Reuters and S\u0026P Capital IQ to calculate total return and market capitalization. Database administrator Larry Shine provided technical support.

That\u0027s the big story in the new \u003Ca title=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/magazines\/fortune\/fortune500\/\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EFortune\u003C\/em\u003E 500\u003C\/a\u003E, our annual survey of the nation\u0027s largest companies, ranked by revenues. After a few years of caution following the financial crisis, in 2012 corporate America was once again seized by the \u0022urge to action\u0022 famously described by economist John Maynard Keynes. The shift to aggressive behavior is exemplified by two major trends in the 500. The first is an increase in spinoffs, as companies shed nonfundamental business units to concentrate on their core strengths. The second is a resurgence in mergers and acquisitions. For several years players have been hoarding cash and shunning expansion. In 2012 they put that cash -- and their rapidly appreciating shares -- to work in the best year for M\u0026amp;A in over a decade.\r\n\r\nA third trend is closely related to the upswing in M\u0026amp;A: Once again, the 500\u0027s earnings stood near record highs. That performance supplied still more cash and the crucial boost in psychology needed to unleash it. Managers gained confidence that they can maintain strong profitability even in a slowly healing economy.\r\n\r\nThe spinoff surge created three new \u003Cem\u003EFortune\u003C\/em\u003E 500 companies on this year\u0027s list. The largest deal came out of Big Oil. The integrated petroleum producers continue to unwind their previous strategy of covering the gamut from drilling to retailing. For several years they\u0027ve been shedding refineries to focus on higher-margin exploration and production. In 2012 the shift accelerated. ConocoPhillips spun off its refining arm as Phillips 66. The new company, Phillips 66 ($169.6 billion in revenues), replaced its former parent at \u003Ca title=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/magazines\/fortune\/fortune500\/2013\/snapshots\/11773.html\u0022\u003ENo. 4\u003C\/a\u003E on the list, while ConocoPhillips fell to \u003Ca title=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/magazines\/fortune\/fortune500\/2013\/snapshots\/327.html\u0022\u003ENo. 45\u003C\/a\u003E.\r\n\r\nAnother spinoff entering the list is Kraft Foods Group (\u003Ca title=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/magazines\/fortune\/fortune500\/2013\/snapshots\/11787.html\u0022\u003ENo. 151\u003C\/a\u003E), the offspring of the former Kraft Foods, which renamed itself Mondelez (\u003Ca title=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/magazines\/fortune\/fortune500\/2013\/snapshots\/293.html\u0022\u003ENo. 88\u003C\/a\u003E). The new Kraft Foods specializes in groceries and beverages (Philadelphia cream cheese, Maxwell House coffee), while Mondelez markets snacks (Oreo cookies, Cadbury candy bars). The third spinoff to join the 500 is one of America\u0027s largest military shipmakers, Huntington Ingalls Industries (\u003Ca title=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/magazines\/fortune\/fortune500\/2013\/snapshots\/11776.html\u0022\u003ENo. 380\u003C\/a\u003E), a manufacturer of destroyers, aircraft carriers, and Coast Guard cutters. Northrop Grumman (\u003Ca title=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/magazines\/fortune\/fortune500\/2013\/snapshots\/305.html\u0022\u003ENo. 120\u003C\/a\u003E) shed Huntington to focus on its core aerospace franchise.\r\n\r\n\u003Ca title=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/gallery\/news\/companies\/2013\/05\/06\/500-spinoffs.fortune\/index.html\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan class=\u0022promo\u0022\u003EMORE: Fortune 500 successful spinoffs\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\r\n\r\nM\u0026amp;A also proved a powerful force in recasting this year\u0027s \u003Cem\u003EFortune\u003C\/em\u003E 500. Thirteen companies exited the list, accounting for $201 billion in sales. That\u0027s almost triple last year\u0027s revenue total for departed companies, and the highest number since 2000. In 10 of those deals, the buyer was another 500 member that in most cases substantially raised its ranking. Once again energy was a prime mover. Energy Transfer Equity, a pipeline company, purchased Sunoco\u0027s 7,900-mile network of pipelines and 4,900 gas stations, doubling revenues to $17.2 billion and rising from No. 312 to \u003Ca title=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/magazines\/fortune\/fortune500\/2013\/snapshots\/11380.html\u0022\u003ENo. 161\u003C\/a\u003E. In fact, Sunoco, which ranked 61st in 2011, disappeared from the list. The petroleum giant also sold its refinery operations to the Carlyle private equity group, and as a result of the two sales, ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nThe health care industry continued its consolidation wave. Companies are expanding in areas where the Affordable Care Act is expected to boost business. A notable example is pharmacy benefit management. Express Scripts made a gigantic jump from No. 60 on last year\u0027s list to \u003Ca title=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/magazines\/fortune\/fortune500\/2013\/snapshots\/10592.html\u0022\u003ENo. 24\u003C\/a\u003E this year by purchasing archrival Medco and now reigns as the nation\u0027s largest manager of prescription drugs. By contrast the tech sector was relatively quiet: The biggest deal was Google\u0027s purchase of Motorola Mobility, making Google (\u003Ca title=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/magazines\/fortune\/fortune500\/2013\/snapshots\/11207.html\u0022\u003ENo. 55\u003C\/a\u003E) not just the supplier of operating systems for Android phones but a manufacturer as well.\r\n\r\nFat profits helped propel those deals. All told, the \u003Cem\u003EFortune\u003C\/em\u003E 500 earned $820 billion in 2012. That represents a minuscule decline of just $4 billion, or 0.5%, from the all-time record, set in 2011. But some sectors fared far better than others. Autos and auto parts, oil exploration and production, and software earned much less than in 2011, while petroleum refining thrived. In motor vehicles, Ford (\u003Ca title=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/magazines\/fortune\/fortune500\/2013\/snapshots\/160.html\u0022\u003ENo. 10\u003C\/a\u003E) and General Motors (\u003Ca title=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/magazines\/fortune\/fortune500\/2013\/snapshots\/175.html\u0022\u003ENo. 7\u003C\/a\u003E) suffered steep declines in earnings, with Ford and GM going from a total of $29 billion to just $11.8 billion. That\u0027s partly because Ford\u0027s 2011 profits were inflated by a huge write-up in the value of its past tax losses. Still, the pair failed to exploit the strong, double-digit growth in the U.S. market, with Ford gaining just 5% in unit sales and GM garnering 3.7%.\r\n\r\n\u003Ca title=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/magazines\/fortune\/fortune500\/2013\/snapshots\/2255.html\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan class=\u0022promo\u0022\u003EMORE: Fortune 500 full list\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\r\n\r\nThe shale gas boom continued to flood the market with natural gas and put downward pressure on prices. Three big natural-gas suppliers -- Devon (\u003Ca title=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/magazines\/fortune\/fortune500\/2013\/snapshots\/10923.html\u0022\u003ENo. 284\u003C\/a\u003E), Chesapeake (\u003Ca title=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/magazines\/fortune\/fortune500\/2013\/snapshots\/11109.html\u0022\u003ENo. 223\u003C\/a\u003E), and Apache (\u003Ca title=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/magazines\/fortune\/fortune500\/2013\/snapshots\/10479.html\u0022\u003ENo. 167\u003C\/a\u003E) -- all saw their profits drop sharply as the price of natural gas plunged 31% in 2012. That collapse forced all three to take large write-downs.\r\n\r\nIn technology Hewlett-Packard (\u003Ca title=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/magazines\/fortune\/fortune500\/2013\/snapshots\/206.html\u0022\u003ENo. 15\u003C\/a\u003E) swung from a profit of $7.1 billion in 2011 to a loss of $12.7 billion last year. That\u0027s the deepest deficit on the list and the 26th worst in \u003Cem\u003EFortune\u003C\/em\u003E 500 history. Two disastrous acquisitions caused most of the damage: HP wrote down $8.8 billion on the value of Autonomy after buying the software maker just 13 months earlier for $11.1 billion, and took another $8 billion charge on its 2008 purchase of Electronic Data Systems.\r\n\r\nThe comeback sector of the year was financial services. All told, the financial sector boasts the highest total profits of any industry group in the 500 for 2012: $200 billion, or $53 billion more than technology, which came in second. America\u0027s biggest banks -- J.P. Morgan Chase (\u003Ca title=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/magazines\/fortune\/fortune500\/2013\/snapshots\/2608.html\u0022\u003ENo. 18\u003C\/a\u003E), Bank of America (\u003Ca title=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/magazines\/fortune\/fortune500\/2013\/snapshots\/2580.html\u0022\u003ENo. 21\u003C\/a\u003E), Wells Fargo (\u003Ca title=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/magazines\/fortune\/fortune500\/2013\/snapshots\/2578.html\u0022\u003ENo. 25\u003C\/a\u003E), and Citigroup (\u003Ca title=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/magazines\/fortune\/fortune500\/2013\/snapshots\/2927.html\u0022\u003ENo. 26\u003C\/a\u003E) -- registered strong profit gains, with a surge in mortgage originations aiding J.P. Morgan and Wells, and all the players benefiting from the fast-improving housing market.\r\n\r\nThe most extraordinary numbers on the entire list, however, come from two casualties of the financial crisis: Fannie Mae (\u003Ca title=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/magazines\/fortune\/fortune500\/2013\/snapshots\/2434.html\u0022\u003ENo. 12\u003C\/a\u003E) and Freddie Mac (\u003Ca title=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/magazines\/fortune\/fortune500\/2013\/snapshots\/3018.html\u0022\u003ENo. 31\u003C\/a\u003E). Those home-loan behemoths lost a combined $258 billion from 2007 to 2011. But last year they earned a total of $28.2 billion, with Fannie\u0027s $17.2 billion in profits ranking sixth among all companies. Fannie and Freddie were helped by a jump in mortgage originations, as well as improved lending standards that enabled them to replace bad loans purchased from 2005 to 2008 with far better-quality mortgages.\r\n\r\n\u003Ca title=\u0022\u0022 href=\u0022http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/gallery\/news\/companies\/2013\/05\/06\/500-stock-gainers.fortune\/index.html\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan class=\u0022promo\u0022\u003EMORE: Fortune 500 biggest stock gainers\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\r\n\r\nFor the future the overriding question for the 500 is whether the era of abundant profits will continue. Right now earnings amount to 6.8% of sales, far above the historical average of around 5.5%. \u0022The easy profit gains are behind us,\u0022 says Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u0027s Analytics. \u0022Margins are as wide as you\u0027ll ever see them, because earnings have grown a lot faster than sales. That can\u0027t continue.\u0022 Indeed, U.S. companies have been growing modestly for a couple of years without rehiring the workers they laid off in the panic of 2008 and 2009. As the economy continues to recover, they\u0027ll be forced to both swell their payrolls and pay higher salaries. Most likely that will hold profit growth to the low single digits in the next year or two, in line with sales, as gravitational forces pull earnings back to the mean.\r\n\r\nBut the fast action that had been missing -- that shifts the tectonic plates of U.S. industry and makes the 500 fun to watch -- is back. Look for future 500s to pack a gallery of surprises, just like this one.\r\n\r\n\u003Cem\u003EThis story is from the May 20, 2013 issue of \u003C\/em\u003EFortune\u003Cem\u003E. \u003C\/em\u003E","post_title":"A year of frenzied activity","post_excerpt":"Flush with profits, America\u0027s biggest companies put their money to work in 2012, fueling a surge in M\u0026amp;A.","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"a-year-of-frenzied-activity","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2014-05-28 10:25:56","post_modified_gmt":"2014-05-28 14:25:56","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/test-alley.fortune.com\/2013\/05\/06\/a-year-of-frenzied-activity\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":275410,"post_author":"12240922","post_date":"2013-05-06 11:15:11","post_date_gmt":"2013-05-06 11:15:11","post_content":"","post_title":"Fortune 500 companies that secretly run your life","post_excerpt":"These companies may not get a lot of attention, but they define the course of our lives in more ways than you might imagine.
